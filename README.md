# Predicting respiratory diseases by the patientâ€™s breathing sounds
### Kaarel Tamuri<br>Stina-Marie Maripuu
<br>
Set within the healthcare industry, this project focuses on supporting the diagnostic process for respiratory diseases. It aims to harness the potential of machine learning to analyze breathing sounds, to help cure patients more effectively and reliably.

The key goal was to develop a machine learning model that assists doctors in identifying respiratory diseases from patients' breathing sounds. The objective is to supplement the traditional diagnostic methods, providing a data-driven tool that could potentially enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnoses.

Goal for project: Build a model that can predict which respiratory disease a patient has based on the audio recordings of their breathing
